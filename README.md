I transitioned from banking to Director of a startup company in 2018.  This is where I found an interest in Information Technology, Cybersecurity, and Data Analytics.  After 2 years, I decided to get back into banking.  During that time I attained my post-graduate degree in Data Science and Business Analytics in 2022.  I also attained the CompTIA Security+ certification in 2023 and the Alteryx Designer Core shortly thereafter.
